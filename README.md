# Domain Types for Go

## What and Why?
These are types that I wish the Go team would include in the standard library so that we could have interoperability between third party packages so we could just depend them on being there. If they were we could write dependency-free code that could interoperate with code from other developers who use the same types in their packges rather than be limited to least-common denominator.

No 3rd party dependencies.
